# Start Without Technical Background

This walkthrough is for people who have not used a terminal, API key, or JSON config file before. The goal is only to get one reply in a browser. You do not need to understand nanobot's architecture or edit its config by hand.

## What You Will Need

- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer.
- Python 3.11 or newer.
- An account or endpoint that can run an AI model.
- The API key, login, endpoint, and model name required by that service. A local model such as Ollama may not require an API key.

An API key is password-like. Do not post it in an issue, screenshot, chat, or public config file.

## A Few Useful Words

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Terminal | A text window where you paste a command and press Enter |
| Command | One instruction typed into the terminal |
| Provider | The service or local server that runs the AI model |
| Model ID | The exact model name expected by that provider |
| API key | A secret credential that lets software call the provider |
| Wizard | A question-and-answer setup menu |
| WebUI | The local browser page where you use nanobot |

## 1. Install Python

Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not already have version 3.11 or newer. On Windows, enable **Add python.exe to PATH** if the installer shows that option.

Open a terminal:

| System | How |
|---|---|
| Windows | Press `Win`, type `PowerShell`, and open Windows PowerShell |
| macOS | Press `Command+Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter |
| Linux | Open your application menu and search for Terminal |

Check Python:

```bash
python --version
```

The result should start with `Python 3.11` or a newer number. If the command is not found, close and reopen the terminal. You can also try `python3 --version` on macOS/Linux or `py --version` on Windows.

## 2. Prepare Your Model Details

nanobot does not create an AI provider account for you. Before setup, have these details nearby:

1. The provider or company endpoint name.
2. Its API key, if it requires one.
3. Its base URL, if its documentation gives you one.
4. A model ID your account can use.

The provider, credential, endpoint, and model must belong together. For example, an API key from one provider usually cannot call a model name copied from a different provider.

## 3. Install nanobot

Copy the command for your system, paste it into the terminal, and press Enter. Copy only the text inside the code block.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/nanobot/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads the stable nanobot package into an isolated Python environment. On a fresh local desktop, it then starts the WebUI and opens your browser. This can take a few minutes on the first run. Keep the terminal open. It prints the exact command used to run nanobot; if `nanobot` is not found later, reuse that whole command instead of switching to a different Python command.

If your organization blocks downloaded install scripts, use the [alternative install methods](./quick-start.md#other-install-methods) or ask your administrator to review the scripts first.

## 4. Configure Your Model in the WebUI

In the browser, open **Settings → Models**. Then:

1. Choose your provider.
2. Enter its API key and base URL when required.
3. Create or select a model preset.
4. Enter a model ID available to your provider account.
5. Save the configuration.

Treat every API key like a password. Do not include it in screenshots or support requests.

If the installer finishes without opening the browser and `nanobot` is available, run:

```bash
nanobot webui
```

If the terminal cannot find `nanobot`, take the exact command printed by the installer and replace its final arguments with `webui`. That command may begin with `uv tool run`, `pipx run`, or the full path to nanobot's private Python environment.

On SSH, a computer without a desktop, an existing configuration, or an older nanobot release, the installer may open the terminal wizard instead. Choose **Quick Start** there and follow its prompts.

## 5. Get the First Reply

Leave the WebUI terminal open. If the browser did not open automatically, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

Send this message:

```text
Hello!
```

A normal assistant reply means setup is complete. The exact reply does not matter.

The first-run address is local to your computer. It is not automatically available to other computers on your network.

## 6. Add One Thing at a Time

Do not configure every feature immediately. Choose one next goal:

| Goal | What to do |
|---|---|
| Change the AI model | Open **Settings → Models** |
| Add a provider credential | Open **Settings → Models**, then find the provider |
| Connect Telegram, Discord, Slack, Feishu, WeChat, or another chat app | Open **Settings → Channels**, choose the platform, and follow its connection steps |
| Add a tool integration | Open **Apps** and choose an App or MCP integration |
| Schedule a reminder or recurring task | Ask nanobot in the target chat, then manage it in **Automations** |
| Work with project files | Start a new chat, choose the project workspace, and review the access setting before sending the task |

Repository docs show the current development version. If your stable package does not yet show **Settings → Channels**, use the [Chat Apps guide](./chat-apps.md) or update to a release that includes it.

Some runtime changes ask you to restart nanobot. Use the restart action shown by the WebUI, or return to the terminal, press `Ctrl+C`, and run `nanobot webui` again.

For a chat platform's account, bot, token, or permission prerequisites, use the [Chat Apps guide](./chat-apps.md). For local models and provider-specific recipes, use the [Provider Cookbook](./provider-cookbook.md).

## If Something Fails

Run these commands one at a time:

```bash
nanobot --version
nanobot status
nanobot agent -m "Hello!"
```

| What you see | What it usually means |
|---|---|
| `nanobot: command not found` | Reuse the exact nanobot command printed by the installer; it points to the isolated environment that contains the package |
| `401`, unauthorized, or invalid API key | The key is wrong, expired, or belongs to a different provider |
| Model not found | The model ID is misspelled or unavailable to your provider account |
| Browser does not open | Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` yourself and keep the terminal running |
| Browser opens but messages fail | Test `nanobot agent -m "Hello!"` to separate a model problem from a WebUI problem |
| A change was saved but nothing changed | Restart nanobot so the running process reloads the config |

If you ask for help, include your operating system, `nanobot --version`, `nanobot status`, the exact command, and the exact error. Remove every API key, bot token, password, OAuth token, and private account ID first.

Continue with the full [Troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) for an ordered diagnosis.

## Open nanobot Later

Run:

```bash
nanobot webui
```

Leave that terminal open while you use nanobot. To stop it, return to the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`. Use `nanobot webui --background` only after the normal foreground start and model setup work; then manage it with `nanobot gateway status`, `logs`, `restart`, and `stop`.
